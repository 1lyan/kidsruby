KidsRuby Editor is an experimental Ruby code environment for kids. It is heavily influenced by Hackety Hack.

Here are a few design goals for it:
- Simple single file editor
- You can run the current contents of the editor
- The output appears next to the editor
- It runs a normal Ruby 1.9.2 on the code

Implementation choices:
- QtRuby app - lets us communicate with the OS to create a full Ruby interactive environment
- Minitest/Minispec for testing. Yes, code must be tested
- Tutorial content is easy to create just drop HTML files on disk locally to the KidsRuby editor.
