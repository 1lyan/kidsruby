KidsRuby Editor is an experimental Ruby code environment for kids. It is heavily influenced by Hackety Hack.

Here are a few design goals for it:
- Simple single file editor
- You can run the current contents of the editor
- The output appears next to the editor
- It runs a normal Ruby 1.9.2 on the code

Implementation choices:
- QtRuby app - lets us communicate with the OS to create a full Ruby interactive environment
- Minitest/Minispec for testing. Yes, code must be tested
- Tutorial content is easy to create just drop HTML files on disk locally to the KidsRuby editor.

Running it:
ruby main.rb

Getting setup on Ubuntu:
Coming soon...

Getting setup on a Mac:
I used the qtbindings gem: https://github.com/ryanmelt/qtbindings
Since I also run homebrew, I discovered that the homebrew install for Qt4 needed a little symlinking before I could run the gem install for qtbindings as described here: https://github.com/ryanmelt/qtbindings/issues#issue/14

To summarize:
brew install qt4mac
for DIR in /usr/local/Cellar/qt/4.7.1/lib/*.framework; do ln -s $DIR/Headers ${DIR%%/lib/*}/include/$(basename $DIR .framework); done
gem install qtbindings


TODOS:
- get syntax highlighting correct for Ruby code
- tabbed pane with stacked widgets for output/turtle/help widgets
- create hackety-hack compatible class for Turtle graphics
- create hackety-hack compatible class with UI dialogs for ask/alert
- local html pages with tutorials
- make it easy to run pie (see what I did there?)
