<article class="lesson"><h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <section class="page"><h1>This is Ruby4Kids</h1>
        <p>Since you are using KidsRuby, you are ready to get started making your first game using Ruby.<br />
        <p>This is the file that will contain our first program.</p>
        <p>We will use the gosu library. </p>
        <p>We will do this by typing:</p>
        <pre><code>require 'gosu'</code></pre>
        <p>We will then start our game by inheriting from the <code>Gosu</code> class</p>
        <p>We will call our game</p>
<pre><code>class MyGame < Gosu::Window
end
</code></pre>
        <p>Now inside of this class, <code>Gosu</code> needs us to define three methods:</p>
        <p>We do this like this:</p>
<pre><code>class MyGame < Gosu::Window
  def initialize
  end

  def update
  end

  def draw
  end
end
</code></pre>
        <p>What happens here is that when the game starts, the <code>initialize</code> method is called.</p>

        <p>Then the game stays running and it goes in a loop, calling the methods: <code>update</code> and <code>draw</code></p>

        <p>Update, then draw, update then draw, update then draw. Like this several times a second.</p>

        <p>OK, so we are almost ready to run this code. The next step that we need to do now is tell <code>Gosu</code> how big a window we want for the game.</p>
        <p>We do this in the <code>initialize</code> method, by passing it three parameters like this</p>
        <pre><code>def initialize
  super(300, 400, false)
end
</code></pre>
        <p>What this does, is make the window 300 pixels wide by 400 pixels high. A pixel is a single dot in your screen. If you put your face right next to the display, you can almost see the dots. Those are called pixels.</p>

        <p>The third parameter you pass to the initialize method is false. This tells gosu not to take over the whole sreen. I hate when games just take over your whole screen. So we will say false for this.</p>

        <p>OK, let's see if this works. Let's run this.</p>

        <p>To run what we have so far, we have to use the class we just defined in our program.</p>

        <p>We do this by adding the following after the class definition.</p>
<pre><code>window = MyGame.new
window.show</code></pre>
        <p>The first line creates an instance of the new game. Then, calling the <code>show</code> method, tells the game to show the game window.</p>

        <p>We are ready to run the program now.</p>

        <p>Now, just click on the "Run" button</p>

        <p>If everything worked correctly, you will have seen your screen show up. You have written your first game program!</p>

        <p>Granted, this does not do anything exciting, but at least you now know how to open a window in a computer game.</p>
