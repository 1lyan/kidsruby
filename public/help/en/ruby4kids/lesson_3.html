  <p> OK, now let's try to make the player move. In the last lesson, we had the image of the player, and now we're going to figure out how to make that player move. </p>
  <p> In gosu, we can use the arrow keys as a way to move our player up, down, left, and right. The game window has an update method, which is where need to check to see if any key was pressed. In programming, we do this via conditional statements, such as <code>if</code> statements. </p>
  <p>So, under <code> def update </code> we write</p>
  <pre><code> 
  if button_down? Gosu::Button:: KbLeft
    @player1.move_left
  end </pre></code>
  <p> So, what the segment above is saying, is that if the left key is pressed, the player will move to the left. However, before before we can define what the left move is, we need to move the player away from a fixed variable of 50,50.</p> 
  <p> If we want the position to move, we have to give it some variables. the way to initialize these variables is in the initialize method. So, under the def initialize method, we already have
  <pre><code>
  @game_window = game_window
  @icon = Gosu::Image.new(@game_window, "images/player1.png", true)
  </pre></code>

  <p> Now, we just need to add </p>
  <pre><code>
  @x = 50
  @y = 50
  </pre></code>

  <p> Next, we are going to replace the <code> 50, 50 </code> in the code <code> @icon.draw(50,50,1) </code> with <code> @x, @y </code>. So, your end result is going to look like this:

  <pre><code> 
  def draw
    @icon.draw(@x,@y,1)
  </pre></code>

  <p> Now, what we did was make the icon moveable by shifting the icon from a fixed position to a variable position using variables! These variables were initialized in the initialize method of the player. So, the starting positions for x and y were each at 50. </p>

  <p> Now we need to make the x position move left every time the player moves left. So, in order to do that, we have to first define "moving left" and then adding a simple equation under that definition. So, we type </p>

  <pre><code>
  def move_left
    @x = @x - 10
</pre></code>
  <p> The equation that we typed moves the icon left by 10 pixels every time we press the arrow key. Go ahead, try it! Cool, huh?</p>
