  <p> When running your program, did you notice that your icon disappears after a while? The guy keeps moving left until he left the screen, never to be seen again :(. </p>

  <p> So, the first thing we're going to do is limit where the icon can go. One of the ways of limiting movement is by adding another conditional under <code>def move_left</code> </p>

  <pre><code>
 def move_left
   if @x < 0
     @x = 0 
  </pre></code>

  <p> Now, what we did above was limit the movement of the icon to stay within a positive x area. That is, if x starts going less than 0, we reset the icon to be at zero. This reset acts as a limit for the icon on the screen. Now, we are going to add another conditional statement called <code>else</code>, which just means "otherwise". So, again, we type enter this code under the <code>def move_left</code></p>

  <pre><code>
  def move_left
   if @x < 0
     @x = 0 
   else
     @x = @x - 10
   end
 end
  </pre></code>

  The <code>else</code>, in this case, refers to regular movement. So, if x is 0 or greater, than the movement to the left is going to be using the code that we developed in the last lesson:<code>@x = @x - 10</code>.</pre> That's it for this lesson! Next, we're going to learn how to move the icons in the other directions.
